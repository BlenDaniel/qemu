**What is noVNC?**

noVNC is an open-source, browser-based VNC (Virtual Network Computing) client that allows you to access and control a remote desktop or application running on a VNC server directly from a web browser using HTML5 and JavaScript. Unlike traditional VNC clients, noVNC requires no installation of dedicated software on the client sideâ€”just a modern web browser. It works by connecting to a VNC server through a WebSocket proxy, enabling real-time, interactive remote desktop sessions via the browser[1][2][5].

To function, noVNC requires three components:
- A VNC server running on the remote machine (e.g., TigerVNC).
- A WebSocket proxy (commonly Websockify) that translates WebSocket traffic from the browser into VNC protocol traffic that the VNC server understands.
- A web server serving the noVNC client files to the browser[1][2].

**How to use noVNC to see the emulator screen instead of a traditional VNC client**

1. **Ensure your emulator container runs a VNC server**  
   Your Android emulator inside the container already runs a VNC server (commonly on port 5900).

2. **Install and set up Websockify and noVNC**  
   - Download or clone the noVNC project from its GitHub repository.  
   - Install Python and the Websockify package (which acts as the WebSocket proxy).  
   - Start the Websockify proxy to forward WebSocket connections from a chosen port (e.g., 6080) to the VNC server port (e.g., 5900 inside the container).

3. **Expose the noVNC port (e.g., 6080) from the container to your host**  
   When running the container, map the noVNC port to the host:
   ```
   docker run -p 6080:6080 -p 5900:5900 
   ```

4. **Access the emulator GUI via browser**  
   Open a modern web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://:6080
   ```
   You will be presented with the noVNC web client interface, which connects through Websockify to the VNC server running the emulator screen.

5. **Authenticate and interact**  
   Enter the VNC password if prompted, and you can now view and interact with the emulator GUI entirely through your browser without needing a separate VNC client[3][4].

**Advantages of using noVNC over a traditional VNC client:**

- No need to install any VNC client software on your local machine.
- Works on any device with a modern browser (desktop, mobile, tablet).
- Easy to share access via a URL.
- Lightweight and platform-independent.

**Summary**

noVNC is a browser-based VNC client that, combined with Websockify as a WebSocket proxy, allows you to access your emulator's VNC server remotely through a web browser. To use it, you set up the noVNC client and Websockify proxy, expose the necessary ports, and then connect via a browser URL. This approach eliminates the need for dedicated VNC client software and provides convenient, cross-platform access to the emulator screen running inside your container[1][2][3][4][5].
